Problem Statement : 
Using the same supplied JSON file as above, write a script in a language of your choice that takes 3 parameters from the user:

A number that represents how long the file should stay in the bucket, after which it is deleted. Let’s call this the number of “retention_days”

A prefix string for object name

Path to json file


 Given the above inputs, your script should find the total number of images that are:

older than the given retention_days (i.e. due for deletion)

Match the given prefix_string


The script should take three inputs:

Path to the JSON file e.g: /Downloads/images.json

Retention days	e.g: 30

Prefix String		e.g: cc-r 


Note:  (todays date - image creation date ) > = retention days
